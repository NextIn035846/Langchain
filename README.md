# ChatBot with OpenAI API and LLM Model
Welcome to the Thomas_ChatBot repository! This project explores the creation of a ChatBot using OpenAI's powerful API, incorporating a Language Model (LLM) for interactive and dynamic conversations. In this repository, we delve into various aspects of the ChatBot, including the implementation of Prompt Templates, a simple Sequential chain, and the exploration of new models.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the ChatBot, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

__Python 3.x__

__OpenAI API key (Sign up at OpenAI to get your API key)__

The ChatBot will interact with the user, generating responses based on the OpenAI model and the chosen conversation strategy.

# Features

__1. OpenAI API Integration__

This ChatBot leverages the OpenAI API to generate responses. The API key is securely stored in the environment variables for authentication.

__2. Language Model Exploration__

Explore the capabilities of different Language Models and experiment with new models to enhance the ChatBot's conversational abilities.

__3. Prompt Templates__

Implement and customize Prompt Templates for specific scenarios, allowing the ChatBot to respond appropriately to predefined user inputs.

__4. Simple Sequential Chain__

Understand and implement a simple Sequential chain for the conversation flow, providing a structured interaction between the user and the ChatBot.
